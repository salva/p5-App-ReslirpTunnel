# App::ReslirpTunnel

## Description

App::ReslirpTunnel is a wrapper for the `reslirp-tunnel` application, which enables the establishment of a network tunnel through an SSH connection, ending in reSLIRP.

This application takes care of all necessary initialization, configuration, and the underlying communication processes needed to maintain the tunnel.

Please note that this module is not designed for direct use; it solely acts as a wrapper for the underlying functionality of the reslirp-tunnel application.
